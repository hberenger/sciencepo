Course material for SciencesPo Coding workshop.

Each folder contains a Processing sketch :

## [Dichotomy](https://github.com/hberenger/sciencespo/tree/master/dichotomy)
Solution of the "_Guess my number_" exercise.

## [Drawing_an_A](https://github.com/hberenger/sciencespo/tree/master/drawing_an_A)
Demonstration of basic display features.

## [Pong](https://github.com/hberenger/sciencespo/tree/master/pong_workshop)
A simple Processing Pong implementation - the one we developped together during the workshop.

## [Face Detector](https://github.com/hberenger/sciencespo/tree/master/face_detector)
A Processing code sample (_snippet_) showing how to capture the camera video stream and detect faces in real time.

⚠️ Requires the **Video** and **OpenCV for Processing** libraries

## [Pong with face control](https://github.com/hberenger/sciencespo/tree/master/pong_face_control)
Our Pong implementation taken a little further : now the paddle is controled by the onscreen position of the player's face.

So basically [Pong with face control](https://github.com/hberenger/sciencespo/tree/master/pong_face_control) = [Pong](https://github.com/hberenger/sciencespo/tree/master/pong_workshop) + [Face Detector](https://github.com/hberenger/sciencespo/tree/master/face_detector)

Compared to what has been shown in class, the mapping of the detected face rectangle to the paddle position is more precise, and we also introduce some motion smoothing.

⚠️ Requires the **Video** and **OpenCV for Processing** libraries

## [Pong p5.js](https://github.com/hberenger/sciencespo/tree/master/pong_base_p5js)
Demonstration of the p5.js mode : a simple ball bouncing on the edges of a frame drawn in a web browser.

⚠️ Requires the **p5.js** mode
